# Formtastic Location Selector

## Installation

First, you'll need to install [Formtastic][1].

Next, install Maptastic as a plugin:

    script/plugin install git@github.com:MattHall/maptastic.git

...and run the rake task to install the required js file into your javascripts directory. You will probably need to include this in your layouts, too.

		    rake maptastic_form:install
		
You can alternatively install the gem:

    gem install maptastic-form

Note if you're using the gem, then you'll need to copy the JS asset from:

    https://github.com/MattHall/maptastic/blob/master/assets/javascripts/maptastic.js

You'll need to add the [Google Maps **V3**][3] script include in your page, above your semantic_form:

    <script type='text/javascript' src='http://maps.google.com/maps/api/js?sensor=true'></script>

Note that you no longer need an API key with the latest Google Maps release.

## Usage

Maptastic adds a new #multi_input method as well as the map control:

    <% semantic_form_for @venue do |f| %>
      <%= f.multi_input :latitude, :longitude, :as => :map %>
    <% end %>

Note that the map input expects two parameters - a latitude and longitude. The order is important.

## Development

This plugin is under development. It's pretty simple, and patches are very welcome.

A [testbed app is available][6] to check that the changes made actually work as expected.
